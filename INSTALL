# Website

Nissy is available at https://nissy.tronto.net

# Requirements

A full installation of nissy requires about 3Gb of space, of which
2.3Gb are occupied by the huge pruning table for fast optimal solving,
and running it requires the same amount of RAM.  One can choose to never
use this function and not to install the relative pruning table. There
is an alternative (slower) optimal solving function that uses about
500Mb of RAM.  When generating the pruning tables automatically (see
the section Tables below), at least 5.3Gb or RAM are required.

# Installation

## On Windows

Try downloading and executing in a terminal the file nissy.exe, then
follow the instructions in the Tables section below for installing the
pruning tables. If nissy.exe does not work, you can try following the
UNIX instructions in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or in a similar
environment.

## On a UNIX system:

Download the source archive (.tar.gz). Extract it with your favorite
archive program, for example with

	tar -xvzf nissy-VERSION.tar.gz

Open a terminal in the directory just extracted. If you wish, edit the
Makefile to match your local configuration (this is usually not necessary,
but you may want to change the PREFIX variable to change the installation
path) and run

	make

followed by

	make install

Then follow the instructions below to install the pruning tables. 

## Tables

Once you have installed nissy, run

	nissy gen

to generate all the tables that Nissy will ever need. Running this
command requires around 5.3Gb of RAM, and it can take some time (about
40 minutes on my fairly old but decent laptop, with 8 CPU threads).

Some unnecessary technical detail: by default this command is going to
use at most 64 threads. If you want you can choose to use more threads
(if your CPU is very powerful) or fewer threads (if you for example
want to run this command in the background while you do other stuff)
with the -t option, for example nissy gen -t 1.

Alternatively, you can download all the tables (1.7Gb) and copy them
into the correct folder (see manual page, ENVIRONMENT section). On UNIX
operating systems this folder is either .nissy/tables in the user's
home directory or $XDG_DATA_HOME/nissy/tables if the XDG variable
is configured. On Windows it is the same directory as the nissy.exe
executable file.

You can downloads all the tables from the following link:

	https://nissy.tronto.net/nissy-tables-2.0.2.zip

# Upgrading

If you already have nissy installed and you want to upgrade to a more
recent version, you can simply repeat the installation process:
* On Windows: simply replace nissy.exe with the new file with the same name.
* On UNIX systems: download the new version of the source code, extract it
  in a new folder and run make and make install again.

Between each version new table files might have been added, or old ones
may be not used anymore. Nissy will deal with this automatically.
