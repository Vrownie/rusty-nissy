# Requirements

A full installation of nissy requires about 1.8Gb of space, of which 1.6Gb are
occupied by the huge pruning table for optimal solving, and running it requires
the same amount of RAM.
One can choose to never use the optimal solver and not to install the relative
pruning table. If so, about 200Mb should be enough.

# Installation

## On Windows

Try downloading and executing in a terminal the file nissy.exe, then
follow the instructions in the UNIX section below for downloading and
installing the pruning tables.
If nissy.exe does not work, you can try following the UNIX instructions
in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or in a similar environment.

Sorry for the inconvenience, I don't have a Windows machine to test this on.

## On a UNIX system:

Edit the Makefile to match your local configuration (usually not necessary, but you
may want to change the PREFIX variable) and run make, followed by make install.
After that, you need to download some files and manually save them to your NISSYDATA
folder (se manual page, ENVIRONMENT section). If you don't do it nissy can compute
these files when needed and save them in the correct folders, but some of them
take hours to generate even for a powerful computer (for reference, the huge pruning
table takes about 20 hours on my laptop).
Choose one of the following:
	https://math.uni.lu/tronto/nissy/nissy-tables-full.zip
	https://math.uni.lu/tronto/nissy/nissy-tables-full.tar.gz
	https://math.uni.lu/tronto/nissy/nissy-tables-nohuge.zip
	https://math.uni.lu/tronto/nissy/nissy-tables-nohuge.tar.gz
extract the archive and copy the tables folder into NISSIDATA (paste there
the whole folder, not file by file). The "nohuge" files are much smaller and do not
contain the huge pruning table for the optimal solver.
