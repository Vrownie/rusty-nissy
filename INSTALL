# Requirements

A full installation of nissy requires a little more than 2Gb of space,
of which 1.6Gb are occupied by the huge pruning table for optimal solving,
and running it requires the same amount of RAM.
One can choose to never use the optimal solver and not to install the relative
pruning table. If so, about 500Mb should be enough.

# Installation

## On Windows

Try downloading and executing in a terminal the file nissy.exe, then
follow the instructions in the Tables section below for
installing the pruning tables.
If nissy.exe does not work, you can try following the UNIX instructions
in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or in a similar environment.

Sorry for the inconvenience, I don't have a Windows machine to test this on.

## On a UNIX system:

Edit the Makefile to match your local configuration (usually not necessary, but you
may want to change the PREFIX variable) and run make, followed by make install.
Follows the instructions below to install the pruning tables.

## Tables
Nissy needs to generate certain large tables to work. These tables are by default
generated the first time they are needed (e.g the first time you ask to solve a
certain step) and then saved to a file. The following times nissy simply loads the
corresponding file from the hard disk.

The very large table for optimal solving can take some time to generate (about 20
minutes on my fairly old but decent laptop, using 8 CPU threads). All other
tables are much faster.

You can ask nissy to generate all the tables it will ever need with the gen
command. It is recommended to use more than one thread, if your CPU has them.
For example, you can run:

nissy gen -t 8

to generate all tables using 8 threads.

Alternatively, you can simply download all the tables and copy them into the
correct folder (see manual page, ENVIRONMENT section).
Choose one of the following:
	https://math.uni.lu/tronto/nissy/nissy-tables-full.zip
	https://math.uni.lu/tronto/nissy/nissy-tables-full.tar.gz
	https://math.uni.lu/tronto/nissy/nissy-tables-nohuge.zip
	https://math.uni.lu/tronto/nissy/nissy-tables-nohuge.tar.gz
extract the archive and copy the tables folder into NISSIDATA (paste there
the whole folder, not file by file). The "nohuge" files are much smaller and do not
contain the huge pruning table for the optimal solver.
