HELP PAGE FOR COMMAND co

SYNTAX
co [OPTIONS] [MOVES|$ID|@ID]

DESCRIPTION
Solves CO for a given scramble. A scramble can be given as last argument of the
command, or an ID of a saved scramble can be provided. If none of the two is
given, a prompt will ask the user to input a new scramble.

OPTIONS
axis={fb,rl,ud}    Specify the axis for the CO. One to three axes can be given,
                   comma separated, no spaces.
                   Default: CO on any of the three axis (omitting the option is
                   the same as specifying axis=fb,rl,ud).
b=N                Specify a bound for the number of moves. N must be a number.
                   Default value: 20.
h                  Show hidden COs.
                   Default, if an CO ending in e.g. F is shown, the equivalent
                   one ending in F' is hidden.
i                  Ignore centers. By default the CO is aligned with centers.
niss               Use NISS.
                   Default: does not use NISS.
n=N                Specify a maximum number of COs to be output. N must be a
                   number.
                   Default value: 1.

EXAMPLES
co axis=fb $1
  Finds one optimal CO on fb for the first saved scramble.

co n=5 b=4 U R F  
  Finds up to 5 COs of length at most 4 for scramble U R F.

co n=100 b=5 niss axis=fb,ud h  R' U' F L R'U'F
  Finds up to 100 COs of lenth at most 4, possibly using NISS, including
  "hidden" COs, excluding the rl axis.
