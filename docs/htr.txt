HELP PAGE FOR COMMAND htr

SYNTAX
htr [OPTIONS] [MOVES|$ID|@ID]

DESCRIPTION
Finds HTR for a given scramble. DR must be solved. A scramble can be given as
last argument of the command, or an ID of a saved scramble can be provided. If
none of the two is given, a prompt will ask the user to input a new scramble.

OPTIONS
from {ud|fb|rl}    Allows to specify on which axis the DR is. This is usually
                   not needed, since nissy will automatically find it out.
b=N                Specify a bound for the number of moves. N must be a number.
                   Default value: 20.
h                  Show hidden HTRs.
                   Default, if an HTR ending in e.g. R is shown, the equivalent
                   one ending in R' is hidden.
niss               Use NISS.
                   Default: does not use NISS.
n=N                Specify a maximum number of HTRs to be output. N must be a
                   number.
                   Default value: 1.

EXAMPLES
eo n=10 b=7 niss $1
  Finds up to 100 HTRs of lenth at most 7, possibly using NISS, including
  "hidden" HTRs, for scramble $1. DR must be solved.
