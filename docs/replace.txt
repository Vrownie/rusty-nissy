SYNTAX
eo [OPTIONS] [MOVES|$ID|@ID]

DESCRIPTION
Looks for non-optimal subsequences and replaces them to shorten the given
sequence. By default it tries to shorten every subsequence of up to 10 moves,
but this can be change with the "b" option.
It outputs at most 10 equivalent optimal sequences for each replaceable part.

OPTIONS
b=N                Finds non-optimal subsequences of up to N moves.

EXAMPLES
replace D2 F' D2 U2 F' L2 R2 U' D B2 D B2 U B2 F L2 R' F' D U' 
  Produces the following output:
Replace [ R2 U' D B2 D B2 ] (moves 7-12) with: [ D R2 D U' ] (-6+4)
Replace [ R2 U' D B2 D B2 U ] (moves 7-13) with: [ D R2 D ] (-7+3)
Replace [ U' D B2 D B2 U ] (moves 8-13) with: [ R2 D R2 D ] (-6+4)
