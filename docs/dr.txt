HELP PAGE FOR COMMAND dr

SYNTAX
dr [OPTIONS] [MOVES|$ID|@ID]

DESCRIPTION
Solves DR for a given scramble. A scramble can be given as last argument of the
command, or an ID of a saved scramble can be provided. If none of the two is
given, a prompt will ask the user to input a new scramble.
If the option "from" is given (see below), it solves DR from an EO (if edges
are oriented) without breaking that EO.
The first time this command is called without the option from (and, to some
extent, also the first time it is called with the option from), nissy loads
some pruning tables that were not loaded on startup, causing a small but
noticeable delay.

OPTIONS
axis={fb,rl,ud}    Specify the axis for the DR. One to three axes can be given,
                   comma separated, no spaces.
                   Default: DR on any of the three axis (omitting the option is
                   the same as specifying axis=fb,rl,ud).
b=N                Specify a bound for the number of moves. N must be a number.
                   Default value: 20.
h                  Show hidden DRs.
                   Default, if an DR ending in e.g. R is shown, the equivalent
                   one ending in R' is hidden.
from {fb|rl|ud}    Solve DR from the specified EO, which must be solved,
                   without breaking the EO.
niss               Use NISS. It works only if solving DR from EO.
                   Default: does not use NISS.
n=N                Specify a maximum number of EOs to be output. N must be a
                   number.
                   Default value: 1.

EXAMPLES
dr from rl axis=ud $1
  Finds optimal DR on ud, starting from EO on rl, for the first saved scramble.

dr niss from fb n=10 m=6 F2 R L B' F D U' R2 L' F D B
  Finds up to 10 DRs of length at most 6 from EO on fb, possibly using NISS.

dr n=100 axis=ud h
  Finds 100 DRs on ud, including "hidden" DRs.
