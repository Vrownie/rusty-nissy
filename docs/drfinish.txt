HELP PAGE FOR COMMAND drfinish

SYNTAX
drfinish [OPTIONS] [MOVES|$ID|@ID]

DESCRIPTION
Solves the given scramble using the DR moveset. DR must be solved. The scramble
can be given as the last argument of the command, or it may be given as an $ID
or @ID, or it can be typed out on the following line.

OPTIONS
from {ud|fb|rl}    Allows to specify on which axis the DR is solved. It is
                   usually not necessary, since nissy will find a DR on any
                   axis, but it can be useful if one want to e.g. solve an HTR
                   state allowing quarter-turns from a specific DR.
b=N                Specify a bound for the number of moves. N must be a number.
                   Default value: 20.
n=N                Specify a maximum number of solutions to be output. N must
                   be a number.
                   Default value: 1.

EXAMPLES
dr from ud R L' U2 R' L F2
  Solves the given scramble using the moveset <U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2>. In this case:
@1:	U2 R2 F2 R2 U2 R2 F2 R2 (8)
drfinish b=7 n=10 $1
  Finds (at most) 10 solutions of length at most 7 for the scramble $1.
