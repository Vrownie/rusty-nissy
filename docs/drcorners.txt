HELP PAGE FOR COMMAND drcorners

SYNTAX
drcorners [OPTIONS] [MOVES|$ID|@ID]

DESCRIPTION
Similar to drfinish, but only solves corners. CO must be solved. The scramble
can be given as the last argument of the command, or it may be given as an $ID
or @ID, or it can be typed out on the following line.

OPTIONS
from {ud|fb|rl}    Allows to specify on which axis the CO is solved. It is
                   usually not necessary, since nissy will find a CO on any
                   axis.
i                  Ignores E-layer centers. By default cornersare solved
                   relatively to centers; this options allows for solutions
                   which solve corners relatively to each other and to the
                   U and D sides, but not to the E layer (or any equivalent
                   if the CO is not on U/D).
b=N                Specify a bound for the number of moves. N must be a number.
                   Default value: 20.
n=N                Specify a maximum number of solutions to be output. N must
                   be a number.
                   Default value: 1.
