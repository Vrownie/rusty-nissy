SYNTAX
solve [MOVES|$ID|@ID]

DESCRIPTION
Solves the given scramble, which can be given as a sequence of moves or as $ID
or @ID. If none is given, the user can type it on the next line.
The algorithm first tries to find a short (<=10 moves) solution, and then
switches to a 2-step algorithm (unless the option "o" is specified, in which
case it keeps looking for an optimal solution).
The first time it uses the 2-step algorithm it needs to load some tables, which
can take a few seconds. It runs much faster after that. If the option "o" is
specified, the first time it loads some large tables, which can take a minute
or two.

OPTIONS
b=N                Only looks for solutions up to N moves.
n=N                Tries to find multiple solutions, at most N. Multiple
                   Solutions will only be found if they are <=10 moves.
o                  Looks for optimal solution.


EXAMPLES
solve R' U' F
  Solves the scramble R' U' F.
solve o b=14 $1
  Tries to solve the scramble $1 optimally, but stops if no solution of 14
  moves or shorter is found.
solve n=16 R L' U2 R' L F2
  Finds the 16 shortest solutions for the scramble above.
