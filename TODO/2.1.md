# TODO-list for version 2.1 (or is it 3.0 at this point?)

## Rework solver

### 1. Implement minimum viable

* Implement nxopt31 with fst_cube. Remember that the function
  move_check_solved() should do one axis at the time, so that we don't move
  everything before checking.
* test?

### 2. Rework achitecture and file dependencies

* solve.h depends only on moves(alg?) (dependency on step and trans is removed).
* Other modules have changed dependencies, might as well rework all.
* Make files smaller, do not include definition in .h, separate
data from abstract operations.
* remove cubetypes.h
* Create a module for multi-step (maybe wait?)
* Possible changes: in step solver, copy cube only if niss; add cleanup function
in solver (called by solve()) to free cube and perhaps pruning tables.
* see various TODO's in files

### 4. More threading options

* Lazy multithread: threads are as independent as possible and only
merged at the end. Ideal when all solutions of a certain length are requested.
* (Done) Eager multithread: current implementation, branches communicate the
number and list of solutions to stop as soon as possible. Good when only one
solution of a certain depth is required.

## Simplify steps

* Remove one type of rotation.
* Change steps to choicestep and stepalt to step (or was this already done?).

## Add missing coordinates and steps

* Check the old file for a list. Many are missing.
* Checkers in steps.c should use coordinates.

## Missing and new commands

* gen
* freemem
* twophase

## Easy improvements

* Solve should re-orient the cube if centers are off
* Solve: add options for -I (inverse only) and -L (linear = normal + inverse).
