# Easy things to improve or add

## Improvements

* Silent batch mode without >>>
* Solutions should be shown sorted: by length first, then by normal moves
  (no niss) first, then it depends on the step (e.g. EO by axis).

## Old commands and steps

* drcorners (solve corners after DR)
* Search and improve suboptimal subsequences

## New commands

* notation: show valid moves
