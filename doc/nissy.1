.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a Rubik's Cube solver. 
It uses techniques from Herbert Kociemba's Cube Explorer and
Tomas Rokicki's nxopt. With 4 cores at 2.5GHz and using less than 3Gb
of RAM, Nissy can find the optimal solution for a random Rubik's cube position
in less than a minute (18 moves or less) to a few minutes.
Nissy can also solve different substeps of the Thistlethwaite's algorithm and more.
.Pp
When run without any argument an interactive shell is launched, otherwise
the provided
.Ar command
is executed and nissy terminates. If the option
.Fl b
is given, every argument after it is ignored and the shell is launched without
any prompt or welcome message. This can be used to run nissy in batch mode,
for example writing a list of commands in a
.Ar file
(one per line) and running
.Ar nissy -b < file
.Pp
The commands that can be run in the interactive shell are the same that can
be run non-interactively and are provided below.
.
.Sh COMMANDS
The available
.Ar commands
are the following:
.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.
.It Nm commands
List all available commands.
.
.It Nm gen Op Fl t Ar N
Generate all tables used by nissy. Run this to complete your installation.
If
.Ar N
is specified,
.Ar N
CPU threads will be used (defaults to 1).
.
.It Nm help Op Ar command
Display help. If no
.Ar command
is given, a generic help message is printed, otherwise a specific help
relative to
.Ar command
is returned.
.
.It Nm print Ar scramble
Display a text-only description of the cube obtained after applying
.Ar scramble .
.
.It Nm quit
Quit nissy.
.
.It Nm solve Ar step Oo Ar options Oc Ar scramble
Solve the given
.Ar step
on the given
.Ar scramble.
By default it finds only one (shortest) solution, without using niss, and it
displays the number of moves at the end of the line.
.
The options for the
.Ar solve
command are the following:
.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.
.It Fl a
Print all solutions: some solutions are filtered out by default for some
steps, for examples EOs that finish with F\(aq, with this options they are not.
.
.It Fl c
Display only the number of solutions found, not the solutions themselves.
.
.It Fl m Ar min
Only look for solution that are at least
.Ar min
moves long.
.
.It Fl M Ar MAX
Only look for solution that are at most
.Ar MAX
moves long.
.
.It Fl n
Allow use of NISS.
.
.It Fl o
Only find solutions that require the minimum number of moves.
.
.It Fl p
Plain style: do not print the number of moves.
.
.It Fl s Ar n
Try to find
.Ar n
solutions. By default and unless the
.Fl M
or
.Fl o
options are used, at most one solution is printed. 
If at least one of
.Fl M
and
.Fl o
is used, all the solutions found within the given bounds are printed.
The option
.Fl s
overwrites these default behaviors and at most
.Ar n
solutions are printed, still satisfiyng the other constraints.
.
.It Fl t Ar n
Use
.Ar n
CPU threads. By default nissy uses only 1 thread. Using more than one
thread will improve performance, but the optimal number depends on your
machine and operating system. Generally, using one less than the number
of threads of your CPU works quite well.
.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode: print some information during the search and print each solution
as it is found instead of only printing them all together at the end.
.
.
.El
.
.It Nm steps
List all available
.Ar steps
for the
.Ar solve
command.
.
.It Nm version
Display version information.
.
.El
.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Data is stored in the folder pointed to by
.Nm $NISSYDATA.
If that variable is unset the folder
.Nm $XDG_DATA_HOME/nissy
or
.Nm $HOME/.nissy
is used instead. If none of this environment variables is defined
(e.g. in a non-UNIX system), the current folder is used.
.
